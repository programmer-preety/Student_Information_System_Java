# 📚 Student Information System (Java)

A **Java-based Student Information System** implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Data Structures** such as **Linked List** and **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for efficient data management.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add New Student** — Store student details (ID, Name, Age, Course, etc.)
- **Search Student** — Quickly find students using Binary Search Tree.
- **Update Student Details** — Modify existing records.
- **Delete Student** — Remove records from the system.
- **Display All Students** — Show all records using Linked List traversal.
- **Sorted Display** — View students sorted by ID or Name (using BST).
- **File Handling** (if implemented) — Save and load records from files.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
- **Java** (Core Java)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
- **Data Structures**
  - **Singly Linked List** — for maintaining student records in insertion order.
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)** — for fast search and sorted output.
- **Algorithms**
  - Search & Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order for BST)
  - Insert & Delete operations in Linked List and BST.
