# 📚 Student Information System (Java)

A **Java-based console application** that manages student records using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and data structures like **Linked List** and **Binary Search Tree (BST)**.  

This project demonstrates encapsulation, modular design, and efficient search techniques for managing student data.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ **Add Student** – Add new student details (ID, Name, Department, Grade)  
- 📋 **View All Students** – Display all student records using a Linked List  
- 🔎 **Search Student by ID (LinkedList)** – Linear search through linked list  
- ⚡ **Search Student by ID (BST)** – Faster search using Binary Search Tree  
- ❌ **Exit Program** – Gracefully exits the system

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java  
- **Concepts Used**:  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Abstraction)  
  - Data Structures: Linked List & Binary Search Tree  
  - User Interaction via `Scanner`

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Run the program  
2. Choose an option from the menu:  
   - Add Student  
   - View All Students  
   - Search Student by ID (LinkedList or BST)  
   - Exit  

3. Students are stored in both:
   - **Linked List** → Maintains order & displays all students  
   - **BST** → Enables faster lookup by ID

## 🖥️ Example Run

## 📊 Data Structures Used

- **Linked List** → Sequential storage & traversal  
- **Binary Search Tree** → Logarithmic time complexity for searching  

This dual storage shows the **trade-offs** between linear vs. tree-based searches.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Navigate to project directory
cd student-information-system

# Compile the program
javac StudentInformationSystem.java

# Run the program
java StudentInformationSystem

✅ Just copy-paste this into your `README.md` and commit — GitHub will render it with proper formatting, emojis, and sections like a professional project page.  

Do you also want me to **add GitHub badges (Java, OOP, Data Structures)** at the top for a more polished look?
